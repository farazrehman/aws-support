# aws-support
This reposistory is a collection of handy scripts (mostly Python) and CLI commands to interface with AWS Support backend. 

**Please make sure that you have the credentials (either stored locally) or via instance role to permit execution of CLI/scripts on your machine**

```
Finally here comes the usual rant...I come up with these commands/scripts while helping customers in the field with their day to day problems and post them here on a public forum with a hope that someone else might find them useful. Having said that, I make no guarantee that these will work in every situation or I will be able to keep them upto date for the future. In other words, please feel free to use them but only at your own risk!!
